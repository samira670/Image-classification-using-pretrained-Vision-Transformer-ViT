This code performs K-fold cross-validation to train a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image classification using the PyTorch framework. Here's a breakdown of the main components:

Imports: Import necessary libraries, including PyTorch, torchvision, timm (an image model library), and other modules for data handling and evaluation.

Set Device and Transforms: Check the availability of GPU (cuda) and set the device accordingly. Define data transforms for training, validation, and testing.

Dataset Splitting: Load the entire dataset and split it into training, validation, and test sets. Update transforms for the validation and test datasets.

Create ViT Model: Define a function create_model() that creates a Vision Transformer model (vit_base_patch16_224) using the timm library. Modify the model's head to match the number of output classes.

Loss Function and Metrics: Define the cross-entropy loss function and a function compute_metrics for computing precision, recall, and F1 score.

KFold Training: Perform K-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is split into K folds, and the model is trained on K-1 folds while validating on the remaining fold. Iterate through each fold, train the model, and collect metrics.

Plotting Results: Average the metrics across all folds and plot the training and validation loss, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for each epoch.

Run KFold Cross-Validation: Finally, the num_epochs variable is set to 10, and the kfold_train_model function is called to execute K-fold cross-validation with 10 folds.

The code utilizes PyTorch's DataLoader for efficient data loading, and the timm library for accessing pre-trained Vision Transformer models. The training loop includes optimization using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a learning rate scheduler, and the model performance is evaluated on training and validation sets. The final plots provide insights into the model's learning progress and generalization performance.
